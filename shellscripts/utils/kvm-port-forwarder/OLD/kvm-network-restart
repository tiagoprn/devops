# Modified by Erico Mendonca (erico.mendonca@suse.com) to add the following:
# 
# - SUSE paths
# - progress messags
# - tighter scope (only change the VMs that use the supplied network name)
#
# (dec 2018)
#
# This work is herewith placed in public domain.
#
# Use this script to cleanly restart the default libvirt network after its
# definition have been changed (e.g. added new static MAC+IP mappings) in order
# for the changes to take effect. Restarting the network alone, however, causes
# the guests to lose connectivity with the host until their network interfaces
# are re-attached.
#
# The script re-attaches the interfaces by obtaining the information about them
# from the current libvirt definitions. It has the following dependencies:
#
#   - virsh (obviously)
#   - tail / head / grep / awk / cut
#   - XML::XPath (e.g. perl-XML-XPath package)
#
# Note that it assumes that the guests have exactly 1 NAC each attached to the
# given network! Extensions to account for more (or none) interfaces etc. are,
# of course, most welcome.
