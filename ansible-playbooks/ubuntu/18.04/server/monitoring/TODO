- [ ] Configure random password for prometheus dashboard

- [ ] Convert alertmanager email configuration to a template so that I can
  configure the e-mail credentials to playbook vars. (see README.md because
probably that was already implemented, just check)

- [ ] Move traefik configuration to a separate playbook. Upgrade to traefik
  2.x.

- [ ] Installing and integrating Grafana (put on a separated playbook, since
    grafana delivers value apart from this setup - also add it to traefik):
