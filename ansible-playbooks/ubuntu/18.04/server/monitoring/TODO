- Finish the prometheus role (the multipass backups are at:
  `/storage/multipass/backups/monitoring-playbook`. If I need to restore one,
after stopping the VM copy the backup file and run `sudo snap restart multipass`)
Use this tutorial:
https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-install-prometheus-and-node-exporter-on-centos-8/#step-configure-prometheus-as-a-systemd-service, and then move on with the instructions on the `README.md` to enable the netdata integration.

- Finish creating the other roles according to those instructions.
- Test on multipass and install on my ubuntu machines and raspberry.
- netdata: add authentication to the dashboard (port 19999)
- promtail + loki to redirect systemd-journald and syslog logs to be viewed in
