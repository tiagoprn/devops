- Secure the following urls:
    - [x] node_exporter: allow only access to the endpoint on localhost (port :9100/metrics)
    - [x] Configure the ports below on firewalld so that they can only be accessed
      locally:
        - [x] netdata (port :19999/).
        - [x] prometheus (port :9090/graph )
        - [x] alertmanager (port :9093 )
    - [ ] Configure below on `traefik.toml` and on `local_dns.sh` (and also on my
      machine on `/etc/hosts`:
        - [DOING] netdata (port :19999/).
        - [ ] prometheus (port :9090/graph )
        - [ ] alertmanager (port :9093 )

- [ ] Installing and integrating Grafana (put on a separated playbook, since
    grafana delivers value apart from this setup):
