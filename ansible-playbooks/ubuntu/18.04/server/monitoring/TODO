- [TESTING] Configure random htpasswd password for the traefik dashboard
(to access, go to https://traefik.example.com)
    * Finished configuration to set the password, but it is not working
      inserted by ansible on /opt/containers/traefik/traefik.toml. But if I ssh
into the VM and create a user with `sudo bash /opt/htpassd.sh`, get the hash
and manually add it to traefik.toml, it works. Check why.
    * An alternative way to setup the credentials may be the docker-compose
      file:

. But that way, when putting the value there I must scape "$" to "$$".

- [ ] Configure random password for prometheus dashboard

- [ ] Convert alertmanager email configuration to a template so that I can
  configure the e-mail credentials to playbook vars. (see README.md because
probably that was already implemented, just check)

- [ ] Move traefik configuration to a separate playbook. Upgrade to traefik
  2.x.

- [ ] Installing and integrating Grafana (put on a separated playbook, since
    grafana delivers value apart from this setup - also add it to traefik):
