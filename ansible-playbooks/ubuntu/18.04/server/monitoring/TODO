- Finish the prometheus role (the multipass backups are at:
  `/storage/multipass/backups/monitoring-playbook`. If I need to restore one,
after stopping the VM copy the backup file and run `sudo snap restart multipass`)
- Finish creating the other roles according to those instructions.
- Test on multipass and install on my ubuntu machines and raspberry.
- netdata: add authentication to the dashboard (port 19999)
