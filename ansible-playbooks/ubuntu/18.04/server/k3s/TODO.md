- Update the playbook with these instructions:

Create self-signed certificates to the cluster:
https://tech.paulcz.net/blog/creating-self-signed-certs-on-kubernetes/

(validate with the instructions on README.md)

- Install openfaas:
  https://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/kubernetes/#b-deploy-with-helm-for-production-most-configurable

- Install k9s

- Maybe change to use k3sup? (the link is on my pocket)
