- [ ] role tmux: run until the tmux role and continue from there (I have made some changes to create an ops user
  instead of dev and to create and add to path the folder where tmux will be installed for the user)
- [ ] Add custom facts to make sysstat, fail2ban and other idempotent like docker and suricata.
- [ ] Create a role to install and configure s3fs and borgbackup (from environment variables).
- [ ] On each role, add a README.md briefly explaining what it does.
