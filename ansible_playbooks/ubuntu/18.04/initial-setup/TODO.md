- [ ] role auth: generate ssh key through ssh-keygen for the root user (if it not exists - create a custom fact to check that) on the playbook, it is failing because it does not have it.
- [ ] Add custom facts to make sysstat, fail2ban and other idempotent like docker and suricata.
- [ ] Create a role to install and configure s3fs and borgbackup (from environment variables).
- [ ] On each role, add a README.md briefly explaining what it does.
