# Run system activity accounting tool every 10 minutes
# There are two issues, here. Firstly, 10 minutes is fairly low resolution. 
# Secondly, the sample only covers 1 second out of 600, so the remaining 9:59 
# are not really included in it. This is somewhat OK for long-term trending, 
# where low-resolution random sampling is sufficient.

# The -S XALL means all statistics should be collected, including interrupts,
